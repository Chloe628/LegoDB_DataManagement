# LegoDB_DataManagement

This is the repository of the projects we submitted during the course of Data Management for Data Science, with professor Riccardo Rosati. 

The main goal of the course is to present the basic concepts of data management systems. 
The first part of the course introduces the main aspects of relational database systems, 
including basic functionalities, file and index organizations, and query processing (first 2 projects).
The second part of the course aims at presenting the main non-relational approaches to data management, 
in particular, multidimensional data management, large-scale data management, and open data management.(3th project).

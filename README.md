# LegoDB_DataManagement

This is the repository of the projects we submitted during the course of Data Management for Data Science, with professor Riccardo Rosati. 

The main goal of the course is to present the basic concepts of data management systems. 
The first part of the course introduces the main aspects of relational database systems, 
including basic functionalities, file and index organizations, and query processing (first 2 projects).
The second part of the course aims at presenting the main non-relational approaches to data management, 
in particular, multidimensional data management, large-scale data management, and open data management.(3th project).

Since we had to choose a dataset, we decided to use the Lego Dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/lego-database
LEGO is a popular brand of toy building bricks. They are often sold in sets with in order to build a specific object. Each set contains a number of parts in different shapes, sizes and colors. This database contains information on which parts are included in different LEGO sets. It was originally compiled to help people who owned some LEGO sets already figure out what other sets they could build with the pieces they had.
This dataset contains the LEGO Parts/Sets/Colors and Inventories of every official LEGO set in the Rebrickable database. These files are current as of July 2017. This dataset was compiled by Rebrickable, which is a website to help identify what LEGO sets can be built given bricks and pieces from other LEGO sets. We choose it because this is a very rich dataset that offers lots of rooms for exploration, especially since the “sets” file includes the year in which a set was first released.
